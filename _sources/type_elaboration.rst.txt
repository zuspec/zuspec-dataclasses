Type Elaboration
################

Zuspec types are always constructed with the assistance of a type 
processor. This is hidden from the user most of the time, though it 
is visible when directly constructing class instances as part of 
procedural construction.

The Type Processor is 

an appropriate TypeProcessor. A TypeProcessor collaborates with 
the Zuspec dataclasses package to elaborate the type structure.
