    Component classes are structural in nature. 
    The lifecycle of a component tree is as follows:
    - The root component and fields of component type are constructed
    - The 'init_down' method is invoked in a depth-first manner
    - The 'init_up' method is invoked

    A Component class supports the following decorated methods:
    - sync
    - constraint
    - activity
