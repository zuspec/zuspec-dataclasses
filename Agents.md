# Zuspec Language

The `zuspec-dataclasses` project provides the `zuspec.dataclasses`
Python package, which defines types and decorators for capturing
models of digital hardware. 

You can learn more about the language by looking at the .rst and
.md files in the `docs` sub-directory.

Note that processing tools for Zuspec classes require access to the
source location. Agent tools cannot generate strings to use instead.
Temp files must be used instead to ensure Zuspec classes have a source location
