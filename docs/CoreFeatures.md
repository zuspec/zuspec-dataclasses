# Philosophy
- Lean into the pythonic
  - Don't try to recreate parameterization
    - In many cases, 'post-build-const' parameters are better
    - Actually, we're trying to convert static parameterization to build-time
  - See how best we can use lambdas to parametetrically-create behavior
  - See how to best incorporate functional programming
- Explicit phases of execution
  - build
  - initialize
  - execute
- Encapsulation is our friend
- Python syntax everywhere ; Python semantics by default  
- Special set of field specifiers that are parent-aware factories

# Capabilities
- RTL synchronous and combinatorial design
-> Must have Verilog equivalents for core features

- 'Bundle' bus interfaces 
-> collections of ports/exports
-> Hierarchical

- Timebase (clock/reset)

- Component fields
  - Param (post-build-time) data
  - Const (post-initialization) data 
  - Mutable data


# Structure
- Component

# Design - TLM

# Design = RTL



# ARL / SRL
- Registers
- Memory and address spaces
-
